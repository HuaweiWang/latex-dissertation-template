LATEX DISSERTATION TEMPLATE

This is a template that conforms to CSU's dissertation standards as best as a LaTeX document can. For your own sanity, don't change any formatting settings, especially:
1) in the section in main.tex before "\begin{document}" and in the appendix section
2) in the title_page.tex
3) in the stuff BEFORE the "chapter" command in each Chapter.tex file. 

In most of this template, you can just fill in the sections with your details. Content within each chapter (i.e. # of sections and # of subsections) is up to you. 

Some (note: SOME, not all) of the format in the Chapters is just an example. It isn't directly specified by CSU. It was created for a clear organization of the dissertation so the readers understand what's happening. If you like it, feel free to use it. If you don't, in each Chapter.tex file, just delete anything AFTER the "\chapter" command and BEFORE the "\abstract" command. If you change something, make sure the titles are still in ALL CAPS, centered, unbolded, 3" from the top, and the same font and size as the text, with double spacing between CHAPTER and TITLE.    

If you change any formatting settings, please go back to the website here and check if the new changes no longer match the CSU template:

CSU is very specific to follow these guidelines as shown, but this Latex format was accepted by the College of Graduate Studies. However, the formatting code of this template look "ugly." If you find a better way of fixing this, then please feel free to update or edit this respository. Please reserve my name as the original template creator. 

Thanks and good luck!
