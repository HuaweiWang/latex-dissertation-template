%Do yourself a favor and check all of your references for formatting as soon as you put them in here.
%Some tips
%1) Authors should be listed consistently. Like A. B. Author for every single entry. Make sure if you use a period that there is a space afterwards.
%2) Include the month, if available
%3) Pages should use -- between, like 1--3
%4) Note that you need to use curly braces to preserve capitalization in article titles. Examples below

@book{book1,
   title = {{A book title}},
   author = {A. A. Author},
   publisher = {Publisher,
   address = {City},
   year = {Year},
}

@book{book2,
   title = {{Another book title}},
   author = {B. B. Author},
   publisher = {Publisher,
   address = {City},
   year = {Year},
}

@ARTICLE{article1,
author={C. C. Author and D. D. Author and E.-E. Author},
journal = {Journal Title with Capitalization},
title = {Journal title with {CAPS} enclosed by {C}urly {B}races},
year = {year},
volume = {volume},
number = {number},
pages = {page1--page2},
month = {Month},
}

@ARTICLE{article2,
author={F. F. Author and G. G. Author},
journal = {Journal Title with Capitalization},
title = {Super fancy scientific title with no capitalization needed},
year = {year},
volume = {volume},
number = {number},
pages = {page1--page2},
month = {Month},
}

@INPROCEEDINGS{conference1,
author={H. H. Author and I. I. Author},
booktitle={Conference Name Here with Capitalization Perserved},
title={Name of article with {CAPS} in {C}urly {B}races},
year={year},
pages={page1--page2},
month = {Month},
}
